A bash shell script aimed to create a base directory for c programming.
It creates the followed structure:
   - bin
   |----\x86
   |----\x64
   - obj
   |----\x86
   |----\x64
   - src
   - inc
It also creates a base Makefile.
Customise it to fit your needs.
Basic clean mrproper all and re are there, but they are empty.
